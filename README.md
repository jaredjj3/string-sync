StringSync is a web application that simplifies learning how to play guitar. It accomplishes this goal by providing a user interface that abstracts the inherent complexities in reading guitar tablature.

## Philosophy
Providing plain tablature is the philosophical equivalent of giving a man a fish to eat for a day. On the other hand, StringSync is teaching that man how to fish. By synchronizing tablature with audio and video, students will naturally rely on their instincts:

>if it sounds good, then it is good

## Technologies

### Backend
StringSync's backend is written in Ruby and uses Postgres for the database engine.

Some of the Ruby libraries used are:

- `rails` web framework
- `devise_token_auth` and `omniauth` authentication and session management

The entire list of Ruby technologies used is in the `Gemfile` of the root of the project.

### Frontend
StringSync's frontend is written in TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript.

Some of the JavaScript libraries used are:

- `react` library used to make interfaces
- `create-react-app` zero configuration tool used to create React projects
- `antd` library of React components to build rich user interfaces
- `j-toker` the client side counterpart of `devise-token-auth`
- `vextab` tablature encoding engine

### Platforms
StringSync uses `heroku` to host the application. It also uses `travis-ci` to automatically run backend and frontend tests whenever a commit is pushed to `master`. If the tests pass, `travis-ci` will run a hook that deploys the application to `heroku`. Otherwise, `travis-ci` will send an email notifying that tests are failing on `master`.
